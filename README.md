How to Play

Step 1: Start the game. You will be prompted to deposit an amount into the machine.

Step 2: Confirm whether you wish to play or quit the game.

Step 3: Choose how many lines you want to bet on, between 1 and 3.

Step 4: Decide how much money you will bet on each chosen line.

Step 5: The results may vary based on symbol occurrence. If the same symbol appears 2 or 3 times, you can win; otherwise, you will lose your bet.

Step 6: If your balance remains positive, you can repeat from Step 2.

Step 7: When you choose to leave the slot machine, there are two outcomes:

    Case 1: If you have a positive balance, you leave with your remaining funds.
    Case 2: If you're out of funds, unfortunately, you may not be able to provide Christmas presents for your kids.
